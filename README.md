kentaromiura's RPG Maker MV Plugins
===================================

Simple repository for my plugins

Current plugins:
```
.
├── Generic
│   └── Debug.js Allows to open the chrome devtool
└── Title
    └── QuitOption.js Add a Close game option on the main menu
```

How to use
==========
there's a deploy script that allows you to deploy all the scripts in your project folder,
it requires you to run `npm install` first.

the dist folder should always be updated with the last available build as it's just the equivalent of running
`./deploy -p dist/`
