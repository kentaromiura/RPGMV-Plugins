kentaromiura's RPG Maker MV Plugins
===================================

Simple repository for my plugins

Current plugins:
```
.
├── Generic
│   └── Debug.js Allows to open the chrome devtool
└── Title
    └── QuitOption.js Add a Close game option on the main menu
```

How to use
==========
there's a deploy script that allows you to deploy all the scripts in your project folder,
in the future I'm planning to support deploying only a subset of plugin,
for now just deploy on any directory and copy only the scripts you need
